At the beginning of our second year at Epitech, we wanted to do a hub project in order to improve the user experience on the Epitech intranet and at the same time increase our skills. After brainstorming on possible improvements to the intranet, we concluded that being able to link one's personal calendar with the Epitech activities calendar could be useful for a large number of students, as it could avoid many students having two separate schedules and optimize their planning.

# Technologies

*Languages*
- `HTML`
- `Js`
- `CSS`

*Back-End*

To inject `HTML` code in the source code of the web page we used `Js`, to send mail we used the javascript module `nodemailer` and for the local server `ExpressJS` which is also a Javascript module.
