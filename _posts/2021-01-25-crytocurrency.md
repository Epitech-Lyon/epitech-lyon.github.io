Today the concept of cryptocurrency is very popular, but what are they really ? 

We will start with this little definition : a cyptocurrency is a digital currency produced by a public network, rather than by a government, that uses cryptography to ensure that payments are sent and received securely.

## Cryptocurrency history

In the 1960’s the Diner’s Club (an American club) created the first credit card ever because they thought that cash was not modern. As a result, in the 1970's, half of Americans got a credit card, which made cash useless because one could pay by card anywhere in the world.

The only problem is that, in countries where there is a dictator or transactions surveillance, people can't spend their money the way they want because someone could say “No!” to a transaction. This is a well-known problem which has a name : _the Byzantins Generals Problem_.

If a base is targeted by an attack of 4 generals, this base will lose the battle if all 4 armies launch the assault, but if one of them decides to betray the others then all of them will die in battle. If each of the generals had access to the choices of the others in real time they would know that some are trying to betray the others so there would be no death. This is what blockchain is about. 

After several decades someone solved it, and his name is Satoshi Nakamoto. No one knows his identity and we may never know it but he created a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin that allows you to buy online and spend anonymously like cash. The Bitcoin and all the cryptocurrencies which followed him are called Blockchain.

## Blockchained explained

The blockchain is a tool for storing and transmitting public information open to all. It is similar to a large account book accessible to all and forgery-proof

Cryptographic techniques are algorithms designed to encrypt (hide) data in order to make them more secure. 
Here the blockchain is used within the framework of the cryptosystems but in view of its transparency, the traceability and the security of the exchanges this method can be used under various forms such as the banking, industrial, pharmaceutical, insurance and health fields.

The "Hash" is the transaction identifier (a code to access the transaction information). 

Example of transaction (The first one in the above history with the hash identifier :

On this picture we can see a summary of the exchange between the two users we can see : 
- The date of transaction 
- The value at the time of the transaction 
- The status of the transaction 
- The fees per transaction byte 

## Usefulness of cryptocurrencies 

The most popular advantage of using cryptography is money transfers! In fact, money transfers using cryptocurrencies are fast and have very low fees. For example, a recent transaction worth __99 million dollars__ made using the currency "Litecoin" would have taken only __1 minute 30 minutes__ and for a fee of only `$0.40`. 

Another advantage is the possibility to invest in recent and innovative start-ups by creating their own cryptocurrencies and then selling them to potential investors. Cryptocurrencies have helped start-ups in this way to the tune of __2 billion dollars__ in the last two years. 

Thanks to the use of cryptocurrencies, it is now possible to travel around the world with a single currency, especially thanks to travel agencies that accept payments in cryptocurrencies such as CheapAir and Destinia. Once in the country, it is also possible to book a hotel room, eat and visit thanks to the cryptocurrencies. 

To conclude on this part it is now possible to buy a Lamborghini through the use of cryptocurrency ! 

The risk of using cryptocurrency:  
- They are volatile: the value of a cryptocurrency may vary from one day to the next. Some cryptocurrencies may be worth `16$` a coin and be at a level of `$0.55` the next day. So if you buy `$1000` of cryptocurrency when its value is at $16 you will have `62,5` tokens. (no matter what the cryptocurrency is). If the value falls you still will have `62,5` tokens with a `$0.55` value each so `$34`. 
- They are unregulated: No government or institution controls a cryptocurrency as opposed to a currency such as the euro or the dollar, making this currency generally unstable and heavily impacted by supply and demand. 
- They are susceptible to being hacked: A cryptocurrency cannot be recovered once it has been sent. You can't get your money back if you get scammed or lose your wallet. Human error is a big flaw in the use of cryptocurrency. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, cryptocurrencies are very interesting for some people and they guarantee anonymity during your online purchases as well as for purchases in partner stores. It is an alternative to cash and credit cards, it's a revolutionary and decentralized currency which opens new doors to finance. The cryptocurrency system is very interesting and other cryptocurrencies are working around the idea of blockchain allowing cryptomoney to evolve constantly.
