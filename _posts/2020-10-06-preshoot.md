My friends ([Jonathan-Emmanuel José][7], [Mohamed Mrabet][8], [Lucas Guichard][6], [Mehdi Zehri][5]) and I wanted to explore a new game engine called [Godot Engine][1], which is said to be very easy to use and has been well accepted by the community.

We decided to build our own game --- a *die and retry* game --- and after almost 2 months of work, *Preshoot* was born and we are very happy to announce that it is available for Android and OSX. 

Below, a little presentation of the game (an exhaustive documentation is available [here][2])

## Menu Title Screen

The menu title screen (the featured image of this post) shows several buttons :
- Play Button, which will load the highest level unlocked or - the first time you launched the game on your phone - launch the tutorial level.
- Levels Button, which will load you the levels scene

## Level Selection

![LevelScreen]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/preshoot/levels.jpg)

In this scene, we can access *10 classic levels* + an
*endless level*. The latter is the only one that does not need to
be unlocked.

The ten other levels need to be unlocked by finishing each
level, one by one. If it isn’t the case, the corresponding button will remain locked.

## Tutorial

![LevelScreen]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/preshoot/restart.jpg)

The game is very difficult, so when the save file is
empty (when you launch the game for the first time for
exemple) the **Play** button on the Menu scene will
redirect you in this tutorial, and all the other levels
(except endless level) will remain locked until you finish.

During this tutorial, some text accompanied by a voice
will explain you how to play.

## Classic Levels

![ClassicLevel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/preshoot/classic.jpg)

This is what the classic levels look like.

We have *arrow keys*, at the bottom right, to record
your movements, we also have *SHOOT* button, at the
bottom left to play your movements.

The goal is to reach teh exit panel
that we can found at the rightmost part of the map (you can zoom out to see the whole map).

![ClassicLevel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/preshoot/zoom.jpg)

You will need to be very concentrate to succeed the ten
levels, but we know you will struggle and maybe rage
quit. So in this case you have an Exit button at the top
left

## Endless levels

This game mode differs from classic levels because it is
an endless loop of mini levels. We prepared some
patterns of map for 3 directions : Top right, Right and
bottom right - we leave the choice of them at random.
Here, the goal is to pass as many sections as possible
with 3 Shoots. But be careful, because if you fail
you will lose a Shoot.

Each 5 sections you pass, because we are good persons, we will
give you an extra shoot (but we will also increase
difficulty).

## Get it!

As we have mentionned earlier the game is freely available [here][3] (+ full documentation and download instructions).

Enjoy it now and don't forget to send us your feedbacks !
